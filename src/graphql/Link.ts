// every field inside the schema definition is backed by one resolver function whose responsibility it is to return the data for precisely that field.
// all the GraphQL server has to do is invoke all resolver functions for the fields that are contained in the query and then package up the response according to the queryâ€™s shape. Query resolution thus merely becomes a process of orchestrating the invocation of resolver functions!
